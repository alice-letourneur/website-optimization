## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

[![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-in%20progress-yellow.svg)]()

My challenge is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques I've picked up.

### Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html

#### Goal 

`index.html` should achieve a PageSpeed score of at least 90 for Mobile and Desktop.

#### Optimizations

`in progress`

### Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

#### Goal

Optimizations made to `views/js/main.js` make `views/pizza.html` render with a consistent frame-rate at 60fps when scrolling.
Time to resize pizzas is less than 5 ms using the pizza size slider on the views/pizza.html page. Resize time is shown in the browser developer tools.

#### Optimizations
